# Lockdown

Make a copy of `hosts.example` that includes the hosts you want to configure.
This requires a user with passwordless sudo by default. (It uses
`ansible_become`.)

## WARNING

If you rely on the root password to administer your server(s) (via `su`), or
logging in as root via ssh, do not apply this recipe. We disable the root
password and disallow root from logging in via ssh.

We check that you aren't using root to run ansible (which implies you have some
other user who can sudo, so you won't lock yourself out), but that isn't a
perfect check.

## Configuration

Check `group_vars/all.yml` for config options.

## Running

Assuming you created a file named `hosts`, run this:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts lockdown.yml
```

## Caveats

I'm a total noob at Ansible; don't look here for best practices. This is just
an exercise to give me a little more familiarity with writing my own Ansible
stuff.
